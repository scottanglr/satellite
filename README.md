# Satellite - My first javascript project

This project is very close to my heart. It taught me that if I solve one problem at a time I can surprise myself with what I'm able to achieve. It was both my first personal programming project and my first javascript project. I only knew a few things about html when I started this, and I had not written any css before.

One weekend I committed myself to learn as much about javascript as possible. I had done a small amount of python programming in school before this. During a class in Physics, while learning about projectile motion, I asked myself “would it be possible to simulate object movement in the browser using the principles of projectile motion?” After breaking seemingly huge chunks, like making a physics engine, into smaller, more manageable chunks, I was able to create this game.

Most of this was created when I was in year 11 and 12 at school. There were just a few small enhancements, such as touch controls and thrust effects added after school.

# Features

As I created the game I created a feature list, marking completion of certain goals.

## Game Engine

### Velocity Vectors and Vector Addition
- Calculates movement distance across frames
- Calculates gravity
- Calculates relative physics. For example takes your velocity and direction
- Face and follow a coordinate

### Collision Detection
- Radius hitbox

### Sprites and Animations
- Player sprite is created by describing a path of relatively positioned points
- Allows for points to change over multiple frames, giving the capability for animations
- To rotate a player it uses a rotation algorithm

### Controls
- Extended number of keys can be held down without conflicting
- Touch controls for touch enabled devices

### Gravity
- Unlimited masses (CPU allowing)
- Unlimited gravity affected elements
- Elements can both apply gravity to other elements and be affected by gravity (meteors)
- Gravity strength can be changed with a slider

### Variable Time
- Time can be slowed down globally
- Capability to slow down time for specific objects. This was to allow for localised bullet time
- Speed of time can be changed with slider

### Motion blur and shadow blur
- Can be toggled on and off

### Game Features
- Real orbital physics
- Acceleration and deceleration
- Multiplayer
- Bullets
- Meteors
- Destruction debris
- Score system
- Animated sun
- Animated stars
- Pause and unease
- Edge teleporting
- Relativistic physics
- Bullet and player trajectory paths
